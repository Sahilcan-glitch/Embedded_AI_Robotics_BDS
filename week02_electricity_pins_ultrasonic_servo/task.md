# Week 2 – Tasks (Submit by: 27/Nov)


## Task 1 – Ultrasonic Distance Reader

Using the Week 2 README and class example, wire the ultrasonic sensor and write a sketch that:

- Measures distance in cm.
- Prints the distance to the Serial Monitor.
- Shows a message like `"TOO CLOSE"` when an object is nearer than your chosen threshold, and `"OK"` otherwise.

Save as: `week02_task2_ultrasonic_reader.ino`

**What to submit:**

- `week02_task2_ultrasonic_reader.ino`
- 1 photo of your **ultrasonic-only** setup.
- 1–2 sentences about one problem you faced (wiring or code) and how you fixed it.


## Task 2– Distance-Controlled Servo

Using your distance code from Task 2 and the servo example in the Week 2 README, write a sketch that:

- Reads distance from the ultrasonic sensor.
- Maps that distance to a servo angle (e.g. close → 0°, far → 180°).
- Prints both distance and angle to the Serial Monitor.

Save as: `week02_task3_ultrasonic_servo.ino`

**What to submit:**

- `week02_task3_ultrasonic_servo.ino`
- 1 photo of your **ultrasonic + servo** setup.
- 1–2 sentences describing how you chose the distance range and angle range.
