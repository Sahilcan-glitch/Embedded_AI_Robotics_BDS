# Week 1 – Tasks (Submit by: DD/MM)

## Task 1 – Custom Blink Pattern

- Start from the Blink example.
- Modify it so the LED:
  - Blinks 3 times fast,
  - Then stays OFF for 2 seconds,
  - Then repeats in a loop.
- Save as `week01_task1_blink_pattern.ino`.

**What to submit:**
- The `.ino` file in your group repo or via email (as instructed).

## Task 2 – Two Buttons, Two LEDs

- Build a circuit with:
  - 2 × buttons
  - 2 × LEDs (with resistors)
- Requirements:
  - Button A controls LED A (ON while pressed, OFF otherwise)
  - Button B controls LED B (ON while pressed, OFF otherwise)
  - When **both** buttons are pressed at the same time, make **both LEDs blink together** (e.g., 3 fast blinks).

**What to submit:**
- `week01_task2_two_buttons_two_leds.ino`
- A photo of your circuit if possible.
